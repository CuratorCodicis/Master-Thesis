# Strategic Approach to Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration
This thesis outlines the effects of quantum computing on the domains of cryptography and software security. Quantum computing poses a significant threat to current public-key encryption algorithms, as it theoretically possesses the ability to solve the underlying mathematical operations in a trivial amount of time. The effects of which are difficult to predict as to the current wide-ranging application of quantum-vulnerable public-key encryption, nonetheless the potential of breach of any information secured through public-key encryption, such as communication over the internet, is grave enough to warrant action. With the estimated time frame of as early as in 10 years time this capability could be achieved and with the danger of harvest-now-decrypt-later type of attacks this prompts an immediate incentive to migrate to quantum-safe cryptography. The current state of governmental policy and legislation regarding cryptography shows an awareness of the danger of quantum computing, but no precedent has been set to change the law for a specific vulnerability. The responsibility to act lies on the private sector to protect itself and dependent actors. Major software and information technology businesses identified the need for quantum-safe cryptography and communicated their efforts to conduct a cryptographic migration of their services. This does not translate to industry-wide knowledge of quantum-safe cryptographic migration. The self reported possible transition timelines on average will miss the estimated breaking point of public-key encryption by several years. The lack of public discussion on general approaches to quantum-safe cryptographic migration reflects such. This thesis aims to engage this research gap by providing an extensive examination of the potential impacts of broken public-key encryption due to quantum computing and proposing a migration strategy to post-quantum cryptography. The strategy is informed by the review of prominent historic migrations, current migration recommendations, and properties of related fields such as software supply chain security and cryptographic agility. The migration strategy is designed to provide guidance in the approach to adopting quantum-safe cryptography and entering a sustainable state of cryptographic security.
